 \itemize{
    \item All the invalid addresses are removed from the input sequence before feeding to Bitonic sorter.\\
    \item An \textit{Address-Resovler} module is introduced for all the inputs\\
    \item The \textit{Address-Resovler} replaces the invalid addresses by $N -1 + C$, where $C$ is position of the comparator ranges from $1$ to $N$ \\
    \item The Bitonic sorter sorts the sequence and all the invalid inputs comes at the end of sorted sequence\\
    \item The Figure below shows the \textit{Address-Resovler} \\

  }
  \item The sorted sequence will be the ascending order , but still can reach to wrong destinations. \\
  \item For eg: If the input is an address sequence $\langle31,X_{1},X_{2},..,X_{31}\rangle$ (where $X_{i}$ indicates invalid address) which results in the sorted output sequence 
					      of $\langle31,32,33,..,63\rangle$. The routing is wrong since the $31$ is routed to target $0$ \\
  \item This is indeed a problem since it demands all the inputs to be valid or any permutations of cosecutive input sequence starts with $0$. For eg :  $\langle 0,1,2,3..\rangle$ or $\langle 0,2,3,1..\rangle$ etc\\
  \item This is solved by using a stage of 32 sequencial Routers \\
  \item The configuration is shown in the Figure below.\\

   \item The Routers determine and shortest path from the hardcoded routing table and forwards to the correct neighbours.\\
  \item In the worst case the time taken for a packet to deliver to destination is $N / 2$ clock cycles\\
  \item The best case is one clock cycle when the DTN has all the inputs ready to be routed $N / 2$\\
  \item Drawback - A \textit{stall} is requried until the packet is delivered to the right destination \\
